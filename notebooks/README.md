# Notebooks
This folder contains the notebooks needed to analyze the data from experiments in the [experiments](../experiments/README.md) folder. They are written to take as their input an hdf5 file as created by [hedfpy](https://github.com/tknapen/hedfpy), and should further require only a standard python data analysis stack. 

# List of Experiments
- [Smooth Pursuit Experiment](smooth_pursuit.ipynb)
- [Saccade Trajectory Experiment](saccade_trajectory.ipynb)
- [Saccade Adaptation Experiment](saccade_adaptation.ipynb)
- [Pupil Response Experiment](pupil_response.ipynb)
- [Gaze Density Experiment](gaze_density.ipynb)


Note that we'll be using Python 3.5 for the notebooks. We recommend that you use miniconda for the installation of all the required software.
